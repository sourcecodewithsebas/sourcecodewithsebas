# 👋🏾 Hi, I'm Sebastian

**`Cybersecurity • Software Engineering • IT Operations`**

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m passionate about exploring technology—building, testing, and dissecting systems to understand how they work and how to secure them. Here, I share my journey, hands-on cybersecurity labs, and projects, while connecting with others who share my enthusiasm for tech.
